#Fall Semester
Period 6

##Main Projects


###Project 4 : Breadcrumbs [FINAL]
####Team Members:
	* Genji Noguchi
	* Justin Kim
	* Eric Chen
#####Description
Breadcrumbs is a social network grounded in the places that we make memories. It takes the user's geolocation data as well as a small message, and places it as a marker on a Google Maps canvas. The site also offers a list view to show all of the crumbs that you have dropped.
The backend is written in Ruby on Rails. The front end implements the Google Maps API as well as the JQuery JS library for simplified AJAX/XMLHTTPRequest calls.

###Project 3 : MTA Smart Alerts
####Team Members:
	* Genji Noguchi
	* Justin Kim
	* Eric Chen
#####Description
It's a flask back-end app that utilizes the MTA and Twilio API's in order to bring you smart MTA alerts for the delays that the MTA has every single freaking day. You can sign up on the website (which uses a Mongo Database), and you can input the trains that you're interested in as well as a cell phone number and a time for when you want to be alerted. If there are delays, then the system will indicate so with an sms message (we wanted to do at the time that the user indicated, but we didn't quite finish that yet.)

###Project 2 : SoftBlog
####Team Members:
	* Genji Noguchi
	* Cooper Weaver
	* Benedict Bolton
	* Sadman Fahmid
####Description
It's a really simple blog engine that stores things inside a SQLite Database. The home page has a easy-to-use two-column interface. On the right is a list of posts in chronological order, showing the first 50 or so characters of the post itself. On the left is a smaller column for trending posts, which are the posts with the most comments.
On clicking on one of the posts, users can comment by putting in a username and comment, and hitting submit.

###Project 1 : Google Search
####Team Members:
	* Genji Noguchi
	* Andreas Wang
	* Sophie Gershon
	* Sunnam Quisbe
####Description:
The website has a really simple interface. All it is is a simple search box in the middle of the screen, and a small signature at the bottom of the screen.
It sends the string to the server, which does a simple check for "What" or "When." It searches for articles with the google module, parses through them with beautifulsoup, then regex's them for time or person. It then sends it to the browser to display it as the different possible queries with different sizes depending on the frequency.
We had some difficulty with the google module, so the articles found are actually hard-coded.
